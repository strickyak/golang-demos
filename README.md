## Demo Programs in GoLang

These are for an introductory class in Go.

Each subdirectory contains one go program, as a single `.go` file in the
`main` package.

The subdirectory names start with a number, which is the order in which
you should read and learn and try the programs.

Demo:

```
$ go run 01-hello/hello.go
$ go run 02-func/func.go
$ go run 03-string/string.go
$ go run 11-slice/slice.go

# These are servers.  Hit Ctrl-C to stop them:
$ go run 21-webserver/webserver.go
$ go run 22-fileserver/fileserver.go
```
